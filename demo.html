        We are in a global asset bubble, not specifically a tech bubble. People like to highlight tech valuations because the general public is familiar with the companies.
            The valuations are divorced from the future earnings of most of the companies, but so are real estate prices in many cities around the world. So sure, we're in a "tech bubble" but its all part of a shared economic fantasy so it probably doesn't matter.

        I think that a correction will happen, but not a bust. Also some companies really need to manage their burn rates, but I guess it's the old saying "spend money to make money".
