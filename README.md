# arguably: make online discussions suck less

Help me make online discussions suck less.

## Ideas and Insights

Discussing general topics (politics, social, think sites like reddit) is not a good experience. Focused questions with one definitive answer work much better (think StackOverflow, Wikipedia).

How do we bring "answers worth saving" to general discussions? So far, online forums rely on threaded answers with some voting, that's it. Can we do better?

Key ideas:

* multiple top comments are ok, there is no one right answer
* comments should be improved by the community, not one single contributor can write the best comment on first attempt, others need to help (similar to wikipedia) 


Most of the visitors are casual readers (lurkers). For them, the value is in quickly seeing the best top comments so they can make up their own mind. They also like to vote for the comments they like most.

A small percentage of visitors write and argue online.

## How you can help

I'm interested in all ideas, feedback and comments to make this work.
